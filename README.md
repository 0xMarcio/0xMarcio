## Exploit Code, Not People! 💥

Welcome to my GitHub! 
I’m passionate about automation, offensive security, and exploiting code vulnerabilities without user interaction. 
My work focuses on building tools and platforms that simplify vulnerability discovery and enhance security workflows.

### 🚀 About Me
- 💻 Offensive Security Analyst specializing in **code-first vulnerabilities**, including **SQL Injection** (SQLi), **Firewall Bypasses**, and **AV Evasion**.
- 🛠️ Proficient in **Bash scripting**, **Python**, **PHP**, **Go**, **C**, and **UNIX tools**. I believe in **code quality** and **automation** to improve efficiency and workflow.
- 🔍 **Exploit Code**: My focus is on technical vulnerabilities that do not rely on user interaction.

### 🏆 Achievements
- Submitted **~2500 vulnerabilities** across platforms like **BugCrowd**, **Invicti**, **HackerOne** and **Open Bug Bounty**.
- Contributed to fixing over **130 vulnerabilities** in various bug bounty programs.
- Ranked in the **Top 25** on the **Hack The Box** leaderboard, demonstrating my capability in CTF and red teaming exercises.

### 🛠️ Tech & Tools I Use
- **Languages & Tools**: C, Python, Go, SQL, Docker, Bash one-liners 💙
- **Security Tools**: BurpSuite, Nmap, Zap, SqlMap, wapiti, the ProjectDiscovery arsenal, and my personal [**Toolbelt**](https://codepwn.win/tools)
- **Automation & Data Parsing**: I use **Trickest** for workflow automation, and **ElasticSearch** for handling large datasets.
- **CTF & Red Teaming**: Regular participant in **Capture The Flag** events, focusing on red teaming and offensive security challenges.

### 🛡️ Automation & other "Quality of Life" stuff I’ve Built
- [**Security Tools Collection**](https://codepwn.win/tools): A platform that aggregates the latest security tools and auto-renders their GitHub READMEs for streamlined access.
- [**Exploit Database**](https://codepwn.win/exploits): Automatically pulls and organizes exploits from **PacketStorm**’s RSS feed, providing immediate access to newly released exploits.
- [**CVE POC Locator**](https://cve.codepwn.win/): Offers fast, fuzzy text searches across the entire CVE dataset, allowing for millisecond response times on CVE lookups. This tool improves vulnerability research by enhancing speed and accuracy.
